## About TTRPGDB

TTRPGDB is a database for Tabletop Role Playing Games. It contains a curated
list of games from all over the world and since the start of the hobby.
The site offers an intuitive search and filter interface to make it easy to
find new and old games to match anyone's style and preferences.

Filter options include:
- Setting (e.g. SciFi, Steampunk, Modern, etc)
- Genre (e.g. Horror, Crime, Action, etc)
- System (e.g. D20, Fate, Forged in the Dark, etc)
- Foundation (i.e. any franchises or media that inspired the game)
- Equipment
- Player options (e.g. Vampires, Heroes, Gods)
- And more...

## Setting up

To run TTRPGDB locally you must have docker installed.
Once you have docker installed you should open up a terminal and navigate to
this directory.
Then run `./vendor/bin/sail up`. The first time this will take a few minutes
as it installs all the dependencies. Subsequent times it will be much quicker.
